##  A little about me

* Working in Elm since October 2016
* Know just enough CSS to get myself into trouble

note:
* Like many other members of Elm Slack channel, I was formerly a back-end programmer in Ruby on Rails.
* Although programming was not my day job, I got interested in front-end programming when I heard about
the Flux architecture, and then implemented a Spotify-like system for retail stores using the DeLorean.js
and Ractive.js libraries
* Became convinced of the importance of immutability after taking Martin Odersky's course on Scala
* Elm appeared on my radar just about the time I was asked to consult on a startup project
* **Big disclaimer**: I find CSS very counterintuitive compared to Elm!
