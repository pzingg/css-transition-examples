##  A little about me

* Working in Elm since October 2016
* Know just enough CSS to get myself into trouble

note:
* I've been a programmer off and on since 1968, most in backend projects, but for the past twelve
months I have been an Elm programmer.
* I became a big fan of immutability and functional programming, when I read what Facebook did with
the Flux architecture and after I took Martin Odersky's online course on Scala.
* I had the opportunity to get back into front-end programming and developed a Spotify-like
system for retail stores using the DeLorean.js and Ractive.js libraries.
* I put Cycle.js on this slide because I think that's also a very interesting project that
also includes some of the sound fundamentals you find in Elm, such as a time traveling debugger,
but I don't think it has the strict type system or friendly compiler messages.
* **Big disclaimer**: I find CSS very counterintuitive compared to Elm!
